# Mini Game Hub

Welcome to the Mini Game Hub project! ðŸŽ®

## Overview

The Mini Game Hub is a showcase project that demonstrates how to utilize the rawg.io API to build a game hub. This project emphasizes fetching data using Axios, handling errors gracefully, and providing a seamless user experience with loading skeletons. Additionally, it leverages Chakra UI for sleek and responsive design, and TypeScript for enhanced code clarity and error checking.

## Features

- Data Fetching: Utilizes Axios to fetch game data from the rawg.io API.

- Error Handling: Provides informative error messages to users in case of API request failures.

- Loading Skeletons: Enhances UX by displaying loading skeletons while fetching data.

- Sleek Design: Built with Chakra UI for a modern and visually appealing user interface.

- TypeScript Integration: Uses TypeScript for type safety and improved development experience.

## Technologies Used

- Axios: For making HTTP requests to the rawg.io API.
- Chakra UI: A simple, modular and accessible component library that gives developers the building blocks they need to build UIs.
- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language, providing improved developer productivity and code quality.
